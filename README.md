*Still optimizing, an nice official YouTube video as well as more in-depth repository documentation will follow sometime in the upcoming weeks.*

For time-stamping purposes, this is as of September 5th 2019 the fastest Lego-based Rubik's Cube solving robot in the world with an average time of ~1.5s (compared to ~2.1s Average of the previous record and main inspiration for this project, CubeTwister). 

**Sample solves:** [1.400](https://youtu.be/E7asXTJ8pAY) (decent, not too lucky), [1.686](https://youtu.be/pTgFNbZgjuA) (fairly unlucky), [0.972](https://youtu.be/JhygBTWfFqc) (ultra lucky)
